# sdl2-image

#### Haskell bindings to SDL_ttf, both high and low-level.

Currently under development.

<!-- This library depends on and is meant to be used with the `new-api` branch of -->
<!-- [haskell-game/sdl2](https://github.com/haskell-game/sdl2). Currently you can -->
<!-- only install it manually from source, after installing sdl2 itself. -->

<!-- ```bash -->
<!-- git clone git@github.com:sbidin/sdl2-ttf.git -->
<!-- cd sdl2-ttf -->
<!-- cabal install -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- A small example executable is included with the library. It loads and displays -->
<!-- a given image. You can find it in the `example` directory. -->

<!-- ```bash -->
<!-- cd sdl2-ttf -->
<!-- cabal run path/to/some/font.ttf -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Both sets of bindings should allow you to use any aspect of the original -->
<!-- SDL_ttf library. Please report an issue if you encounter a problem/bug -->
<!-- or feel that something is missing or should be added. -->
